Unfortunately, there isn’t a golden rule on age for a laptop or when it should be replaced.

**It will depend mainly on the following:**

● What you use your laptop for;
● How you’ve taken care of your laptop;
● How it is acting

For a laptop that doesn’t have any problems, it can last upwards of seven or eight years. However, if you want to have the latest apps and programs, then you may need to upgrade every three or so years.

Sometimes, it will be possible to upgrade an existing laptop instead of buying a new laptop altogether.
